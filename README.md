# Dog-breed-Classification
The Dog Breed Classification project is an application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the field of computer vision. It aims to develop a model capable of accurately identifying and classifying different dog breeds from input images. CNNs are particularly well-suited for this task due to their ability to learn hierarchical patterns and features in images. The project typically involves collecting a large dataset of labeled dog images, which includes various breeds. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. The CNN model is trained on the training set, where it learns to recognize and extract meaningful features from the images. Through multiple convolutional and pooling layers, the model identifies patterns and characteristics specific to different dog breeds. After training, the model is evaluated on the testing set to assess its performance and accuracy. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust and accurate dog breed classifier that can be used in various applications, such as dog identification, pet services, and animal welfare.
